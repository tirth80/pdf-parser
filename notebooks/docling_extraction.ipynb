Security  threats  are  a  significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats  to  our  own  IT  infrastructure  can  also  affect  our  customers.  Customers  using  our  cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers' on-premises or cloud  environments,  sometimes  exploiting  previously  unknown  ('zero  day')  vulnerabilities,  such  as occurred  in  early  calendar  year  2021  with  several  of  our  Exchange  Server  on-premises  products. Vulnerabilities  in  these  or  any  product  can  persist  even  after  we  have  issued  security  patches  if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers' systems. Adversaries will continue  to  attack  customers  using  our  cloud  services  as  customers  embrace  digital  transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users' accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer's use of our products or services.

Forward-looking  statements  may  appear  throughout  this  report, including the following sections: 'Business' (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K), 'Risk Factors' (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K), and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K).

We  continued  to  make  progress  on  our  goals,  with  our  overall  emissions declining  by  0.5  percent.  While  our  Scope  1  and  Scope  2  emissions  continued  to  decline,  Scope  3 emissions increased by 0.5 percent. Scope 3 represented 96 percent of our total emissions, resulting primarily from the operations of our suppliers and the use of our products across our customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few examples of our continued progress include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Signed new power purchase agreements, bringing our total portfolio of carbon-free energy to over 13.5 gigawatts.\n",
      "- Contracted  for  water  replenishment  projects  that  are  estimated  to  provide  more  than  15.6 million cubic meters in volumetric water benefit over the lifetime of these projects.\n",
      "- Diverted  12,159  metric  tons  of  solid  waste  from  landfills  and  incinerators  across  our  direct operational footprint.\n",
      "- Protected  12,270  acres  of  land  in  Belize  -  more  than  the  11,206  acres  of  land  that  we  use around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft has a role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but we recognize that no solution  can  be  offered  by  any  single  company,  organization,  or  government.  Our  approach  helps  to support the sustainability  needs  of  our  customers  and  the  global  community.  Our  Microsoft  Cloud  for Sustainability, an environmental sustainability management platform that includes Microsoft Sustainability  Manager,  enables  organizations  to  record,  report,  and  reduce  their  Scope  1,  2,  and  3 emissions.  These  digital  tools  can  interoperate  with  business  systems  and  unify  data  intelligence  for organizations.\n",

      "\n",
      "In fiscal year 2023, we collaborated with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to launch and scale a number of projects and programs, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Working  with  103  unique  organizations  in  165  cities  and  counties  on  our  Justice  Reform Initiative  to  empower  communities  and  advance  racial  equity  and  fairness  in  the  justice system.\n",
      "- Increasing  access  to  affordable  broadband,  devices,  and  digital  literacy  training  across  14 geographies, including 11 cities and three states in the Black Rural south.\n",
      "- Growing our Nonprofit Tech Acceleration for Black and African American Communities program, which uses data, technology, and partnerships to help more than 2,000 local organizations to modernize and streamline operations.\n",

We are also increasing investment activity with Blackand African American-owned asset managers, which now represent 45 percent of our external manager group, enabling increased funds into local communities. We also met our goal of creating a $100 million program  focused  on  mission-driven  banks.  We  enriched  our  supplier  pipeline,  achieving  our  goal  to spend $500 million with double the number of Black- and African American-owned suppliers. We also increased  the  number  of  identified  partners  in  the  Black  Partner  Growth  Initiative  by  more  than  250 percent, surpassing our initial goal.\n",

      "We have made meaningful progress on representation and inclusion at Microsoft. As of June 2023, we are 93 percent of the way to our 2025 commitment to double the number of Black and African American people managers in the U.S. (below director level), and 107 percent of the way for Black and African American  directors  (people  managers  and  individual  contributors).  We  are  28  percent  of  the  way  for Hispanic and Latinx people managers (below director level) and 74 percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx directors.\n",

      "## Investing in Digital Skills\n",
      "\n",
      "After helping over 80 million jobseekers around the world access digital skilling resources, we introduced a new Skills for Jobs initiative to support a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible learning paths to develop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs. Our Skills for Jobs initiative brings together learning resources, certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn,  GitHub,  and  Microsoft  Learn,  and  is  built  on  data  insights  drawn  from  LinkedIn's  Economic Graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also launched a national campaign to help skill and recruit 250,000 people into the cybersecurity workforce by 2025, representing half of the country's workforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum available free of charge to all of the nation's higher education institutions, providing training for new and existing faculty, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students. We have expanded the cyber skills initiative to 27 additional countries that show elevated cyberthreat risks  coupled  with  significant  gaps  in  their  cybersecurity  workforces,  partnering  with  nonprofits  and other educational institutions to train the next generation of cybersecurity workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI is creating unparalleled opportunities to empower workers globally, but only if everyone has  the  skills  to  use  it.  T o  address  this,  in  June  2023  we  launched  a  new  AI  Skills  Initiative  to  help everyone learn how to harness the power of AI. This includes a new LinkedIn learning pathway offering new  coursework  on  learning  the  foundations  of  generative  AI.

Employees participate in our Employee Signals surveys, which cover  a  variety  of  topics  such  as  thriving,  inclusion,  team  culture,  wellbeing,  and  learning  and development. We also collect Daily Signals employee survey responses, giving us real-time insights into ways we can support our employees.

These  programs  reinforce  our  culture  and  values  such  as  collaboration  and  growth  mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others  and  contribute  to  the  success  of  our  colleagues.  We  monitor  pay  equity  and  career  progress across multiple dimensions. Our total compensation opportunity is highly differentiated and is market competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to manage our costs in a dynamic, competitive environment, in fiscal year 2023 we announced that base salaries of salaried employees would remain at fiscal year 2022 levels. Pay increases continue to be available for rewards-eligible hourly and equivalent employees. We will continue our practice of investing in stock for all rewards-eligible employees, salaried and hourly, and investing in bonuses for all eligible employees.\n",

      "## PART I Item 1\n",
      "\n",
      "Since  2016,  we  have  reported  on  pay  equity  as  part  of  our  annual  Diversity  and  Inclusion  report.  In 2022, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.008 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.007 for every $1.000 earned  by  their  counterparts  who  are  men,  and  that  women  outside  the  U.S.  earn  $1.002  for  every $1.000  earned  by  their  counterparts  outside  the  U.S.  who  are  men.  In  this  year's  report,  we  again expanded our pay equity data beyond the U.S. to report on 61 additional countries (up from 12 last year), representing 99.8% of our global Microsoft workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "In  addition,  we  began  reporting  on  unadjusted median pay in our annual report, comparing total pay amounts for all employees regardless of factors such as job title, level, or tenure. For employees who are eligible for rewards, the analysis showed that total pay for women is 89.6% of total pay for men in the U.S. and 86.2% outside of the U.S., and total pay for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. is 89.9% of total  pay  for  white  employees.  As  we  continue  to  increase  representation  for  women  and  racial  and ethnic minorities at more senior levels, and continue to ensure pay equity for all, the gap between the medians will reduce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our intended result  is  a  global  performance  and  development  approach  that  fosters  our  culture,  and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance.\n",

Generally, we also create product documentation internally.\n",
      "\n",
      "We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that  apply  to  our  software  and  hardware  products,  services,  business  plans,  and  branding.  We  are  a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 70,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 19,000 pending worldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed  intellectual  property  in  our  products  and  services,  we  also  engage  in  outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees' products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and  services.  At  times,  we  make  select  intellectual  property  broadly  available  at  no  or  low  cost  to achieve  a  strategic  objective,  such  as  promoting  industry  standards,  advancing  interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external development community.  Our  increasing  engagement  with  open  source  software  will  also  cause  us  to  license  our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "While  it  may  be  necessary  in  the  future  to  seek  or  renew  licenses  relating  to  various  aspects  of  our products  and  services,  we  believe,  based  upon  past  experience  and  industry  practice,  such  licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Investing in the Future\n",
      "\n",
      "Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our  customers  and  growth  for  the  company.  Based  on  our  assessment  of  key  technology  trends,  we maintain  our  long-term  commitment  to  research  and  development  across  a  wide  spectrum  of technologies,  tools,  and  platforms  spanning  digital  work  and  life  experiences,  cloud  computing,  AI, devices, and operating systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "While our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "We  plan  to  continue  to  make  significant  investments  in  a  broad  range  of  product  research  and development  activities,  and  as  appropriate  we  will  coordinate  our  research  and  development  across operating segments and leverage the results across the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "In  addition  to  our  main  research  and  development  operations,  we  also  operate  Microsoft  Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world's largest corporate research organizations, often working in close collaboration with top universities around the world, and is focused on advancing the state-of-the-art in computer  science  and  a  broad  range  of  other  disciplines.  Our  investment  in  fundamental  research provides us a unique perspective on future trends and contributes to our innovation.\n",

      "## DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING\n",
      "\n",
      "We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors  and  resellers.  Our  sales  organization  performs  a  variety  of  functions,  including  working directly  with  commercial  enterprises  and  public-sector  organizations  worldwide  to  identify  and  meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system  integrators,  independent  software  vendors,  and  other  partners  who  engage  directly  with  our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "## OEMs\n",
      "\n",
      "We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers  they  sell.  The  largest  component  of  the  OEM  business  is  the  Windows  operating  system  preinstalled  on  devices.  OEMs  also  sell  devices  pre-installed  with  other  Microsoft  products  and  services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n",
      "\n",
      "There  are  two  broad  categories  of  OEMs.  The  largest  category  of  OEMs  are  direct  OEMs  as  our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including  Dell,  Hewlett-Packard,  Lenovo,  and  with  many  regional  and  local  OEMs.  The  second  broad category  of  OEMs  are  system  builders  consisting  of  lower-volume  PC  manufacturers,  which  source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Direct\n",
      "\n",
      "Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services  ('Enterprise  Agreement  Software  Advisors'  or  'ESA').  Microsoft  offers  direct  sales  programs targeted  to  reach  small,  medium,  and  corporate  customers,  in  addition  to  those  offered  through  the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "We  also  sell  commercial  and  consumer  products  and  services  directly  to  customers,  such  as  cloud services,  search,  and  gaming,  through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online  stores.  Additionally,  our Microsoft  Experience  Centers  are  designed  to  facilitate  deeper  engagement  with  our  partners  and customers across industries.\n",

      "## Distributors and Resellers\n",
      "\n",
      "Organizations  also  license  our  products  and  services  indirectly,  primarily  through  licensing  solution partners  ('LSP'),  distributors,  value-added  resellers  ('VAR'),  and  retailers.  Although  each  type  of reselling partner may  reach  organizations  of  all sizes, LSPs  are primarily  engaged  with  large organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small  and  medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing  programs.  Microsoft  Cloud  Solution  Provider  is  our  main  partner  program  for  reselling  cloud services.\n",
      "\n",
      "We  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.\n",

      "\n",
      "## LICENSING OPTIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail  channels.  We  use  different  programs  designed  to  provide  flexibility  for  organizations  of  various sizes.  While  these  programs  may  differ  in  various  parts  of  the  world,  generally  they  include  those discussed below.\n",
      "\n",
      "SA  conveys  rights  to  new  software  and  upgrades  for  perpetual  licenses  released  over  the  contract period. It also provides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.\n",

      "\n",
      "Our  operations  and  financial  results  are  subject  to  various  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "## STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\n",
      "\n",
      "## We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Competition in the technology sector\n",
      "\n",
      "Our  competitors  range  in  size  from  diversified  global  companies  with  significant  research  and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective  in  deploying  technical,  marketing,  and  financial  resources.  Barriers  to  entry  in  many  of  our businesses  are  low  and  many  of  the  areas  in  which  we  compete  evolve  rapidly  with  changing  and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Competition among platform-based ecosystems\n",
      "\n",
      "An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects  among  users,  application  developers,  and  the  platform  provider  that  can  accelerate  growth. Establishing  significant  scale  in  the  marketplace  is  necessary  to  achieve  and  maintain  attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A  competing  vertically-integrated  model,  in  which  a  single  firm  controls  the  software  and hardware  elements  of  a  product  and  related  services,  has  succeeded  with  some  consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from  their  vertically  integrated  offer.  We  also  offer  some  vertically-integrated  hardware  and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.\n",
      "- We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such  as  smartphones  and  tablet  computers.  These  devices  compete  on  multiple  bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning  to  these  devices  to  perform  functions  that  in  the  past  were  performed  by  personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing  platforms  could  increase  their  competitive  strength.  In  addition,  some  of  our devices  compete  with  products  made  by  our  original  equipment  manufacturer  ('OEM') partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.\n",
      "- Competing  platforms  have  content  and  application  marketplaces  with  scale  and  significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors' content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors'  rules  governing  their  content  and  applications  marketplaces  may  restrict  our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Business model competition\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Even  as  we  transition  more  of  our  business  to  infrastructure-,  platform-,  and  software-as-aservice business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products  through  investments  in  research  and  development,  offsetting  these  costs  with  the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n",
      "- We  are  investing  in  artificial  intelligence  ('AI')  across  the  entire  company  and  infusing generative  AI capabilities  into  our  consumer  and  commercial  offerings.  We  expect  AI technology and services to be a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. We will bear significant  development  and  operational  costs  to  build  and  support  the  AI  capabilities, products, and services necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change, potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny.\n",
      "- Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n",
      "- Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, using open source AI models, and earning revenue on advertising or  integrated  products  and  services.  These  firms  do  not  bear  the  full  costs  of  research  and development for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  competitive  pressures  described  above  may  cause  decreased  sales  volumes,  price  reductions, and/or  increased  operating  costs,  such  as  for  research  and  development,  marketing,  and  sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our  increasing  focus  on  cloud-based  services  presents  execution  and  competitive  risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services  that  utilize  ubiquitous  computing  and  ambient  intelligence  to  drive  insights  and  productivity gains. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user's choice of which cloud-based services to use. Certain industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may present enhanced risks. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies.  The  Windows  ecosystem  must  continue  to  evolve  with  this  changing  environment.  We embrace  cultural  and  organizational  changes  to  drive  accountability  and  eliminate  obstacles  to innovation.  Our  intelligent  cloud  and  intelligent  edge  offerings  are  connected  to  the  growth  of  the Internet of Things ('IoT'), a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and  computing  capabilities,  including  AI.  Our  success  in  driving  ubiquitous  computing  and  ambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure AI, and Azure IoT Edge. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives.\n",

      "We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition,  we  are  focused  on  developing  new  AI  platform  services  and  incorporating  AI  into  existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness,  developer  support,  and  effective  distribution  and  marketing.  If  customers  do  not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like  Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing  Chat,  that  drive  post-sale  monetization  opportunities.  Our  data  handling  practices  across  our products  and  services  will  continue  to  be  under  scrutiny.  Perceptions  of  mismanagement,  driven  by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.\n",

We  expect  to  continue  making  acquisitions  and  entering  into  joint  ventures  and  strategic alliances  as  part  of  our  long-term  business  strategy.  For  example,  in  March  2021  we  completed  our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. for $68.7 billion. In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges  and  risks,  including  that  they  do  not  advance  our  business  strategy,  that  we  get  an unsatisfactory  return  on  our  investment,  that  they  raise  new  compliance-related  obligations  and challenges,  that  we  have  difficulty  integrating  and  retaining  new  employees,  business  systems,  and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our  existing  products  and  services  or  develop  compelling  new  ones,  as  well  as  acquired  companies' ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected.

      "Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities  or  intentionally designed processes  in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our  employees,  users,  partners,  or  customers  to  disclose  passwords  or  other  sensitive  information  or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users' or customers' data, or acting in a coordinated manner  to  launch  distributed  denial  of  service  or  other  coordinated  attacks.  Nation-state  and  statesponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security or organizational security practices may  also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators  may  fail  to  timely  remove  employee  account  access  when  no  longer  appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users' security or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to  detect  certain  vulnerabilities  or  new  attack  methods,  which  may  allow  them  to  persist  in  the environment  over  long  periods  of  time.  Cyberthreats  can  have  cascading  impacts  that  unfold  with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches  of  our  facilities,  network,  or  data  security  could  disrupt  the  security  of  our  systems  and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their  data,  result  in  product  development  delays,  compromise  confidential  or  technical  business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We  are  also  subject  to  supply  chain  cyberattacks  where  malware  can  be  introduced  to  a  software provider's customers, including us, through software updates.\n",

We  embrace  new  ways  of  sharing  data  and  communicating  internally  and  with partners  and  customers  using  methods  such  as  social  networking  and  other  consumer-oriented technologies.  Increasing  use  of  generative  AI  models  in  our  internal  systems  may  create  new  attack methods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide.\n",

      "The security of our products and services is important in our customers' decisions to purchase or use our products  or  services  across  cloud  and  on-premises  environments.  Security  threats  are  a  significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats  to  our  own  IT  infrastructure  can  also  affect  our  customers.  Customers  using  our  cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers' on-premises or cloud  environments,  sometimes  exploiting  previously  unknown  ('zero  day')  vulnerabilities,  such  as occurred  in  early  calendar  year  2021  with  several  of  our  Exchange  Server  on-premises  products. Vulnerabilities  in  these  or  any  product  can  persist  even  after  we  have  issued  security  patches  if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers' systems. Adversaries will continue  to  attack  customers  using  our  cloud  services  as  customers  embrace  digital  transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users' accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer's use of our products or services. We are increasingly incorporating  open  source  software  into  our  products.  There  may  be  vulnerabilities  in  open  source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Additionally, we are actively adding new  generative  AI  features  to  our  services.  Because  generative  AI  is  a  new  field,  understanding  of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that rely on generative AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries.\n",

      "Our  customers  operate  complex  IT  systems  with  third-party  hardware  and  software  from  multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers' vulnerability to attack.  Further,  customers  of  widely  varied  size  and  technical  sophistication  use  our  technology,  and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of  technical  sophistication  when  defining  default  settings  for  our  products  and  services,  including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults.\n",

We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how  to  detect  or  track  an  attack,  especially  where  an  attack  involves  on-premises  software  such  as Exchange  Server  where  we  may  have  no  or  limited visibility into our  customers'  computing environments.\n",

      "The  cost  of  measures  to  protect  products  and  customer-facing  services  could  reduce  our  operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to  reduce  or  delay  future  purchases  of  products  or  subscriptions  to  services,  or  to  use  competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail  to  adopt  adequate  security  practices.  Any  of  these  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation  and revenue.  Actual  or  perceived  vulnerabilities  may  lead  to  claims  against  us.  Our  license  agreements typically  contain  provisions  that  eliminate  or  limit  our  exposure  to  liability,  but  there  is  no  assurance these  provisions  will  withstand  legal  challenges.  At  times,  to  achieve  commercial  objectives,  we  may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.\n",

      "Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile  data  breaches  provides  evidence  of  an  external  environment  increasingly  hostile  to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties  on  data  security,  and  other  practices  we  follow  may  not  prevent  the  improper  disclosure  or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises  or,  increasingly,  in  a  cloud-based  environment  we  host.  Government  authorities  can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere,  we  advocate  for  transparency  concerning  these  requests  and  appropriate  limitations  on government  authority  to  compel  disclosure.  Despite  our  efforts  to  protect  customer  and  user  data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer  or  user  concerns,  or  constraints  on  our  flexibility  to  determine  where  and  how  to  operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.\n",

Human review of certain outputs may be required. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union ('EU'), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.\n",

      "We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land,  predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units ('GPUs') and other components. The cost or availability of these  dependencies  could  be  adversely  affected  by  a  variety  of  factors,  including  the  transition  to  a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft  T eams,  Dynamics  365,  OneDrive,  SharePoint  Online,  Skype,  Xbox,  and  Outlook.com  through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform  and  back-end  hosting  for  services  provided  by  third  parties  to  their  end  users.  Maintaining, securing,  and  expanding  this  infrastructure  is  expensive  and  complex,  and  requires  development  of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive  and  regulatory  constraints  that  continue  to  evolve.  Inefficiencies or operational  failures,  including  temporary  or  permanent  loss  of  customer  data,  insufficient  Internet connectivity,  insufficient  or  unavailable  power  supply,  or  inadequate  storage  and  compute  capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current  and  potential  users,  subscribers,  and  advertisers,  each  of  which  may  adversely  impact  our consolidated financial statements.\n",

Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release  testing  could  cause  reduced  sales  and  revenue,  damage  to  our  reputation,  repair  or remediation  costs,  delays  in  the  release  of  new  products  or  versions,  or  legal  liability.  Although  our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\n",

Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in  Asia  and  other  geographies  that  may  be  subject  to  disruptions  in  the  supply  chain,  resulting  in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.\n",

As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners,  creating  a  risk  that  we  fail  to  do  so  in  compliance  with  competition  rules.  Regulatory scrutiny  in  this  area  may  increase.  Certain  foreign  governments,  particularly  in  China  and  other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.\n",

New  competition  law  actions  could  be  initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of our assets, adversely affecting our ability to monetize  our  products,  or  inhibiting  our  ability  to  consummate  acquisition  or  impose  conditions  on acquisitions that may reduce their value.\n",

      "Laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ('FCPA') and other  anti-corruption  laws  and  regulations  ('Anti-Corruption  Laws')  prohibit  corrupt  payments  by  our employees,  vendors,  or  agents,  and  the  accounting  provisions  of  the  FCPA  require  us  to  maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure  to  comply  with  Anti-Corruption  Laws  or  competition  laws  could  result  in  significant  fines  and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.\n",

      "Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication  technologies  into  our  supply  chain  and  allow  for  government  review  of  transactions involving  information  and  communications  technology  from  countries  determined  to  be  foreign adversaries.  Supply  chain  regulations  may  impact  the  availability  of  goods  or  result  in  additional regulatory  scrutiny.  Periods  of  intense  diplomatic  or  armed  conflict,  such  as  the  ongoing  conflict  in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions  could  result  in  reputational  harm,  operational  delays,  monetary  fines,  loss  of  revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions.\n",

      "Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our  services  or  result  in  increased  costs,  legal  claims,  fines  against  us,  or  reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating  to  the  collection,  storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ('DPF') has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause  the  legal  requirements  for  data  transfers  from  the  EU  to  be  uncertain.  EU  data  protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services.\n",

      "In  addition,  the  EU  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  ('GDPR'),  which  applies  to  all  of  our  activities conducted  from  an  establishment  in  the  EU  or  related  to  products  and  services  offered  in  the  EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data  in  our  products  and  services.  Engineering  efforts  to  build  and  maintain  capabilities  to  facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other  projects.  We  might  experience  reduced  demand  for  our  offerings  if  we  are  unable  to  engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data  regulations,  or  if  our  implementation  to  comply  makes  our  offerings  less  attractive.  Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers),  it  may  lead  to  regulatory  enforcement  actions,  which  can  result  in  significant  monetary penalties,  private  lawsuits,  reputational  damage,  blockage  of  international  data  transfers,  and  loss  of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have  adopted,  or  are  considering  adopting  or  expanding,  laws  and  regulations  imposing  obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data.\n",

Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may  result  in  burdensome  or  inconsistent  requirements,  including  data  sovereignty  and  localization requirements,  affecting  the  location,  movement,  collection,  and  use  of  our  customer  and  internal employee  data  as  well  as  the  management  of  that  data.  Compliance  with  applicable  laws  and regulations  regarding  personal  data  may  require  changes  in  services,  business  practices,  or  internal systems  that  result  in  increased  costs,  lower  revenue,  reduced  efficiency,  or  greater  difficulty  in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing  or  new  rules  may  result  in  significant  penalties  or  orders  to  stop  the  alleged  noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.\n",

Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European  Electronic  Communications  Code,  increasingly  define  certain  of  our  services  as  regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations are  expanding  mandatory  disclosure,  reporting,  and  diligence  requirements.  Legislative  or  regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to achieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity.

In addition, governments' approach to enforcement,  and  our  products  and  services,  are  continuing  to  evolve.  Compliance  with  existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant activity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders across many of these areas.

Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges  not  present  in  private  commercial  agreements.  For  instance,  we  may  be  subject  to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a  governmental  contractor,  we  could  incur  civil  and  criminal  fines  and  penalties,  and  under  certain circumstances  contracts  may  be  rescinded.  Some  agreements  may  allow  a  government  to  terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic  funding  approval,  reductions,  cancellations,    or  delays  which  could  adversely  impact  publicsector  demand  for  our  products  and  services.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the  course  of  our  business,  there  are  many  transactions  and  calculations  where  the  ultimate  tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ('TCJA') and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect  to  the  TCJA  or  possible  future  legislative  changes,  and  as  we  gather  more  information  and perform more analysis,  our  results  may  differ  from  previous  estimates  and  may  materially  affect  our consolidated financial statements.\n",

      "We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision  for  income  taxes  and  our  tax  estimates  are  reasonable,  tax  authorities  may  disagree  with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.\n",

In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many  countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations,  decisions,  policies,  and  positions  may  materially  adversely  impact  our  consolidated financial statements.\n",

Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global  basis  is  difficult.  Similarly,  the  absence  of  harmonized  patent  laws  makes  it  more  difficult  to ensure consistent respect for patent rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. Additionally, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations  to  pay  us  royalties  or  may  contest  the  scope  and  extent  of  their  obligations.  Finally,  our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our revenue may be adversely affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. T o resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and  licensing  agreements  on  terms  that  are  less  favorable  than  currently  available,  stop  selling  or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.\n",

Our  reputation  and  brands  are  globally  recognized  and  are  important  to  our  business.  Our reputation  and  brands  affect  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  consumer,  business,  and  public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights  record.  We  may  experience  backlash  from  customers,  government  entities,  advocacy  groups, employees,  and  other  stakeholders  that  disagree  with  our  product  offering  decisions  or  public  policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like.\n",
      "- Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content.\n",
      "- Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.\n",

      "The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that  run  our  software  have  also  been  a  significant  means  of  distribution.  The  impact  of  economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\n",

      "We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt,  our  investment  portfolio  may  be  adversely  affected  and  we  could  determine  that  more  of  our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\n",

A disruption or failure of  our  systems  or  operations  because  of  a  major  earthquake,  weather  event,  cyberattack,  terrorist attack,  pandemic,  or  other  catastrophic  event  could  cause  delays  in  completing  sales,  providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements.\n",

These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our  operating  strategies,  access  to  national,  regional,  and  global  markets,  hiring,  and  profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.\n",

      "The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our  business  going  forward  will  depend  on  factors  such  as  the  duration  and  scope  of  the  pandemic; governmental,  business,  and  individuals'  actions  in  response  to  the  pandemic;  and  the  impact  on economic  activity,  including  the  possibility  of  recession  or  financial  market  instability.  Measures  to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors.\n",

      "Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession,  as  well  as  political  and  military  disputes.  In  addition,  our  international  growth  strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and  commercial  environments.  Changes  to  trade  policy  or  agreements  as  a  result  of  populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and nonlocal sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more  difficult  to  sell  our  products  in  foreign  countries.  Disruptions  of  these  kinds  in  developed  or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services,  impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs.

      "Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to  U.S.  immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability  to  adequately  staff  our  research  and  development  efforts.  If  we  are  less  successful  in  our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important  to  our  long-term  success.  Failure  to  ensure  effective  transfer  of  knowledge  and  smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating  costs  and  less  flexibility  in  how  we  meet  our  workforce  needs.  Our  global  workforce  is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union.

      "## OVERVIEW\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. We are creating the platforms and tools, powered by artificial intelligence ('AI'), that deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support small and large business competitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes, grow public-sector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people  and  businesses;  licensing  and  supporting  an  array  of  software  products;  delivering  relevant online  advertising  to  a  global  audience;  and  designing  and  selling  devices.  Our  most  significant expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including  datacenter  operations;  designing,  manufacturing,  marketing,  and  selling  our  other  products and services; and income taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $111.6 billion.\n",
      "- Office  Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 10% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 13%.\n",
      "- Office  Consumer  products  and  cloud  services  revenue  increased  2%  and  Microsoft  365 Consumer subscribers increased to 67.0 million.\n",
      "- LinkedIn revenue increased 10%.\n",
      "- Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 16% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.\n",
      "- Server products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 29%.\n",
      "- Windows  original  equipment  manufacturer  licensing  ('Windows  OEM')  revenue  decreased 25%.\n",
      "- Devices revenue decreased 24%.\n",
      "- Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5%.\n",
      "- Xbox content and services revenue decreased 3%.\n",
      "- Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 11%.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Industry Trends\n",
      "\n",
      "Our  industry  is  dynamic  and  highly  competitive,  with  frequent  changes  in  both  technologies  and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new  ideas  that  can  further  transform  the  industry  and  our  business.  At  Microsoft,  we  push  the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors  are  developing  new  software  and  devices,  while  also  deploying  competing  cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of  cloud-based  services  to  use.  Aggregate  demand  for  our  software,  services,  and  devices  is  also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating  costs  and  may  decrease  our  operating  margins.  We  continue  to  identify  and  evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including  graphics  processing  units  ('GPUs')  and  other  components.  Our  devices  are  primarily manufactured  by  third-party  contract  manufacturers.  For  the  majority  of  our  products,  we  have  the ability  to  use  other  manufacturers  if  a  current  vendor  becomes  unavailable  or  unable  to  meet  our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified  suppliers.  Extended  disruptions  at  these  suppliers  could  impact  our  ability  to  manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one's career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these  revenue  and  expenses  are  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  As  a  result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S.  dollar  relative  to  certain  foreign  currencies  reduced  reported  revenue  and  expenses  from  our international operations in fiscal year 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "On January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we  recorded  a  $1.2  billion  charge  in  the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2023  ('Q2  charge'),  which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas,  we  will  continue  to  hire  in  key  strategic  areas.  Second,  we  are  allocating  both  our  capital  and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating  our  leases  to  create  higher  density  across  our  workspaces,  which  impacted  our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Seasonality\n",
      "\n",
      "Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multiyear on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Change in Accounting Estimate\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to  investments  in  software  that  increased  efficiencies  in  how  we  operate  our  server  and  network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives  of  both  server  and  network  equipment  from  four  years  to  six  years.  This  change  in  accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Reportable Segments\n",
      "\n",
      "We  report  our  financial  performance  based  on  the  following  segments:  Productivity  and  Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&amp;A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Metrics\n",
      "\n",
      "We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the  allocation  of  resources.  We  disclose  metrics  to  enable  investors  to  evaluate  progress  against  our ambitions,  provide  transparency  into  performance  trends,  and  reflect  the  continued  evolution  of  our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&amp;A or the Notes to Financial  Statements  (Part  II,  Item  8  of  this  Form  10-K).  Financial  metrics  are  calculated  based  on financial  results  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United States of America ('GAAP'), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for  certain  metrics,  most  notably  expanding  our  Surface  metric  into  a  broader  Devices  metric  to incorporate additional revenue streams, along with other minor changes to align with how we manage our businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Commercial\n",
      "\n",
      "Our commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Office Commercial, Windows  Commercial,  the  commercial  portion  of  LinkedIn,  Enterprise  Services,  and  Dynamics.

Equity  investments  were  $9.9  billion  and  $6.9  billion  as  of  June  30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation.  They  consist  predominantly  of  highly  liquid  investment-grade  fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our  fixed-income  investments  are  exposed  to  interest  rate  risk  and  credit  risk.  The  credit  risk  and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices.

      "\n",
      "In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments,  such  as  U.S.  government  securities,  common  and  preferred  stock,  and  mutual  funds.  If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such  as  commercial  paper,  certificates  of  deposit,  U.S.  agency  securities,  foreign  government  bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities,  corporate  notes  and  bonds,  and  municipal  securities.  Level  3 investments  are  valued  using  internally-developed  models  with  unobservable  inputs.  Assets  and liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  basis  using  unobservable  inputs  are  an  immaterial portion of our portfolio.\n",

Broker  pricing  is  used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced  investments  are  generally  classified  as  Level  2  investments  because  the  broker  prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\n",

Cash used in financing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, due to a $20.4 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $8.2 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.\n",

      "Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenue,  and  expenses.  Critical  accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in  the  areas  of  revenue  recognition,  impairment  of  investment  securities,  goodwill,  research  and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\n",

      "## Revenue Recognition\n",
      "\n",
      "Our  contracts  with  customers  often  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  products  and  services  to  a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that  should  be  accounted  for  separately  versus  together  may  require  significant  judgment.  When  a cloud-based  service  includes  both  on-premises  software  licenses  and  cloud  services,  judgment  is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services,  primarily  Office  365,  depend  on  a  significant  level  of  integration,  interdependency,  and interrelation  between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price ('SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including onpremises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts  to  estimate  SSP  when  we  sell  each  of  the  products  and  services  separately  and  need  to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately,  we  determine  the  SSP  using  information  that  may  include  market  conditions  and  other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification  of  those  products  and  services  by  customers  and  circumstances.  In  these  instances,  we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Impairment of Investment Securities\n",
      "\n",
      "We review debt investments quarterly for  credit  losses  and  impairment.  If  the  cost  of  an  investment exceeds its fair  value,  we  evaluate,  among  other  factors,  general  market  conditions,  credit  quality  of debt  instrument  issuers,  and  the  extent  to  which  the  fair  value  is  less  than  cost.  This  determination requires  significant  judgment.  In  making  this  judgment,  we  employ  a  systematic  methodology  that considers  available  quantitative  and  qualitative  evidence  in  evaluating  potential  impairment  of  our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we  will  be  required  to  sell  the  security  before  recovery,  then  a  decline  in  fair  value  below  cost  is recorded  as  an  impairment  charge  in  other  income  (expense),  net  and  a  new  cost  basis  in  the investment  is  established.  If  market,  industry,  and/or  investee  conditions  deteriorate,  we  may  incur future impairments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair  value  of  the  investment  to  determine  the  amount  of  the  impairment  loss.  Once  an  investment  is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.\n",
      "\n",
      "## PART II Item 7\n",
      "\n",
      "## Goodwill\n",
      "\n",
      "We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  (operating  segment  or  one  level  below  an  operating  segment)  on  an  annual  basis  (May  1)  and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and  determination  of  the  fair  value  of  each  reporting  unit.  The  fair  value  of  each  reporting  unit  is estimated  primarily  through  the  use  of  a  discounted  cash  flow  methodology.  This  analysis  requires significant  judgments,  including  estimation  of  future  cash  flows,  which  is  dependent  on  internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results,  market  conditions,  and  other  factors.  Changes  in  these  estimates  and  assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\n",

      "## Research and Development Costs\n",
      "\n",
      "Costs  incurred  internally  in  researching  and  developing  a  computer  software  product  are  charged  to expense  until  technological  feasibility  has  been  established  for  the  product.  Once  technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to  customers.  Judgment  is  required  in  determining  when  technological  feasibility  of  a  product  is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Legal and Other Contingencies\n",
      "\n",
      "The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors,  the  degree  of  probability  of  an  unfavorable  outcome  and  the  ability  to  make  a reasonable  estimate  of  the  amount  of  loss.  Changes  in  these  factors  could  materially  impact  our consolidated financial statements.\n",

      "## PART II Item 7\n",
      "\n",
      "## Income Taxes\n",
      "\n",
      "The  objectives  of  accounting  for  income  taxes  are  to  recognize  the  amount  of  taxes  payable  or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax  benefits  recognized  in  the  financial  statements  from  such  a  position  are  measured  based  on  the largest  benefit  that  has  a  greater  than  50%  likelihood  of  being  realized  upon  ultimate  settlement. Accounting  literature  also  provides  guidance  on  derecognition  of  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities, classification  of  deferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  accounting  for  interest  and  penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.

      "\n",
      "Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable  value  is  the  estimated  selling  price  less  estimated  costs  of  completion,  disposal,  and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product  life  cycle  status,  product  development  plans,  current  sales  levels,  pricing  strategy,  and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\n",

      "\n",
      "We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these  prior  period  amounts  had  no  impact  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets,  consolidated  income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Principles of Consolidation\n",
      "\n",
      "The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Estimates and Assumptions\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include:  for  revenue  recognition,  determining  the  nature  and  timing  of  satisfaction  of  performance obligations,  and  determining the standalone selling price ('SSP') of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties;  the  fair  value  of  and/or  potential  impairment  of  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  for  our reporting  units;  product  life  cycles;  useful  lives  of  our  tangible  and  intangible  assets;  allowances  for doubtful  accounts;  the  market  value  of,  and  demand  for,  our  inventory;  stock-based  compensation forfeiture  rates;  when  technological  feasibility  is  achieved  for  our  products;  the  potential  outcome  of uncertain  tax  positions  that  have  been  recognized  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements  or  tax returns;  and  determining  the  timing  and  amount  of  impairments  for  investments.  Actual  results  and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to  investments  in  software  that  increased  efficiencies  in  how  we  operate  our  server  and  network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives  of  both  server  and  network  equipment  from  four  years  to  six  years.  This  change  in  accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Foreign Currencies\n",
      "\n",
      "Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n",

      "## Revenue Recognition\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue  is  recognized  upon  transfer  of  control  of  promised  products  or  services  to  customers  in  an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We  enter  into  contracts  that  can  include  various  combinations  of  products  and  services,  which  are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized  net of allowances  for returns and  any  taxes  collected  from  customers,  which  are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Nature of Products and Services\n",
      "\n",
      "Licenses  for  on-premises  software  provide  the  customer  with  a  right  to  use  the  software  as  it  exists when  made  available  to  the  customer.  Customers  may  purchase  perpetual  licenses  or  subscribe  to licenses,  which  provide  customers  with  the  same  functionality  and  differ  mainly  in  the  duration  over which  the  customer  benefits  from  the  software.  Revenue  from  distinct  on-premises  licenses  is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where  we  allocate  revenue  to  software  updates,  primarily  because  the  updates  are  provided  at  no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain  volume  licensing  programs,  including  Enterprise  Agreements,  include  on-premises  licenses combined with Software Assurance ('SA'). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over  the  contract  period  and  provides  support,  tools,  and  training  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use products  more  efficiently.  On-premises  licenses  are  considered  distinct  performance  obligations  when sold  with  SA.  Revenue  allocated  to  SA  is  generally  recognized  ratably  over  the  contract  period  as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to  cloud  services  provided  on  a  subscription  basis  is  recognized  ratably  over  the  contract  period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in  a  period,  is  recognized  based  on  the  customer  utilization  of  such  resources.  When  cloud  services require  a  significant  level  of  integration  and  interdependency  with  software  and  the  individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership  is  transferred  to  resellers  or  directly  to  end  customers  through  retail  stores  and  online marketplaces.\n",

      "## Significant Judgments\n",
      "\n",
      "Our  contracts  with  customers  often  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  products  and  services  to  a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that  should  be  accounted  for  separately  versus  together  may  require  significant  judgment.  When  a cloud-based  service  includes  both  on-premises  software  licenses  and  cloud  services,  judgment  is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services,  primarily  Office  365,  depend  on  a  significant  level  of  integration,  interdependency,  and interrelation  between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately,  we  determine  the  SSP  using  information  that  may  include  market  conditions  and  other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification  of  those  products  and  services  by  customers  and  circumstances.  In  these  instances,  we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n",
      "\n",
      "Timing  of  revenue  recognition  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  invoicing  to  customers.  We  record  a receivable  when  revenue  is  recognized  prior  to  invoicing,  or  unearned  revenue  when  revenue  is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unearned  revenue  comprises  mainly  unearned  revenue  related  to  volume  licensing  programs,  which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each  contract  period  for  multi-year  agreements  and  recognized  ratably  over  the  coverage  period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions,  Office  365  subscriptions,  Xbox  subscriptions,  Windows  post-delivery  support,  Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Refer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component.  The  primary  purpose  of  our  invoicing  terms  is  to  provide  customers  with  simplified  and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n",

We  have  determined  that  certain  sales  incentive programs  meet  the  requirements  to  be  capitalized.  T otal  capitalized  costs  to  obtain  a  contract  were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n",
      "\n",

These  costs  include  our internal sales organization compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.\n",

      "## Cost of Revenue\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating  costs  related  to  product  support  service  centers  and  product  distribution  centers;  costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers ('OEM'), to drive traffic to our  websites,  and  to  acquire  online  advertising  space;  costs  incurred  to  support  and  maintain  cloudbased and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory  valuation  adjustments;  costs  associated  with  the  delivery  of  consulting  services;  and  the amortization  of  capitalized  software  development  costs.  Capitalized  software  development  costs  are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.\n",

      "## Product Warranty\n",
      "\n",
      "We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical  and  projected  product  failure  rates,  historical  and  projected  repair  costs,  and  knowledge  of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate  our  estimates  to  assess  the  adequacy  of  the  recorded  warranty  liabilities  and  adjust  the amounts as necessary.\n",

      "\n",
      "Research  and  development  expenses  include  payroll,  employee  benefits,  stock-based  compensation expense,  and  other  headcount-related  expenses  associated  with  product  development.  Research  and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs and the amortization  of  purchased  software  code  and  services  content.  Such  costs  related  to  software development  are  included  in  research  and  development  expense  until  the  point  that  technological feasibility  is  reached,  which  for  our  software  products,  is  generally  shortly  before  the  products  are released  to  production.  Once  technological  feasibility  is  reached,  such  costs  are  capitalized  and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.\n",

      "\n",
      "Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $904 million, $1.5 billion, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n",

      "Compensation  cost  for  stock  awards,  which  include  restricted  stock  units  ('RSUs')  and  performance stock units ('PSUs'), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.\n",

      "On January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $800 million of employee severance expenses related to these job eliminations as part of an  ongoing  employee  benefit  plan.  These  employee  severance  expenses  were  incurred  as  part  of  a corporate  program,  and  were  included  in  general  and  administrative  expenses  in  our  consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based on relative gross margin. Refer to Note 19 Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information.\n",

      "Income  tax  expense  includes  U.S.  and  international  income  taxes,  and  interest  and  penalties  on uncertain  tax  positions.  Certain  income  and  expenses  are  not  reported  in  tax  returns  and  financial statements  in  the  same  year.  The  tax  effect  of  such  temporary  differences  is  reported  as  deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.\n",

      "\n",
      "We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values.  In  general,  investments  with  original  maturities  of  greater  than  three  months  and  remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded  in  other  comprehensive  income.  Fair  value  is  calculated  based  on  publicly  available  market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. T o determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider  specific  adverse  conditions  related  to  the  financial  health  of,  and  business  outlook  for,  the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments  for  observable  changes  in  price  or  impairments  (referred  to  as  the  measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Derivatives\n",
      "\n",
      "Derivative  instruments  are  recognized  as  either  assets  or  liabilities  and  measured  at  fair  value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\n",

      "For  derivative  instruments  designated  as  fair  value  hedges,  gains  and  losses  are  recognized  in  other income  (expense),  net  with  offsetting  gains  and  losses  on  the  hedged  items.  Gains  and  losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\n",
      "\n",
      "For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\n",
      "\n",
      "For  derivative  instruments  that  are  not  designated  as  hedges,  gains  and  losses  from  changes  in  fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Fair Value Measurements\n",
      "\n",
      "We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Level 1 -  inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock,  and  mutual  funds.  Our  Level  1  derivative  assets  and  liabilities  include  those  actively traded on exchanges.\n",
      "- Level 2 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices  for  identical  or  similar  instruments  in  markets  that  are  not  active,  and  model-based valuation  techniques  (e.g.  the  Black-Scholes  model)  for  which  all  significant  inputs  are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the  full  term  of  the  assets  or  liabilities.  Where  applicable,  these  models  project  future  cash flows  and  discount  the  future  amounts  to  a  present  value  using  market-based  observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit,  U.S.  agency  securities,  foreign  government  bonds,  mortgage-  and  asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.\n",
      "- Level 3 -  inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted  cash  flow  models.  Our  Level  3  assets  and  liabilities  include  investments  in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are  recorded  at  fair  value  due  to  an  impairment  charge.  Unobservable  inputs  used  in  the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair  values  of  these  investments  are  determined  based  on  valuation  techniques  using  the  best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Inventories\n",
      "\n",
      "Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable  value  is  the  estimated  selling  price  less  estimated  costs  of  completion,  disposal,  and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Property and Equipment\n",
      "\n",
      "Property  and  equipment  is  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation,  and  depreciated  using  the straight-line  method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated  useful  lives  of  our  property  and  equipment  are  generally  as  follows:  computer  software developed or acquired for internal use, three  years; computer equipment, two to six years; buildings and  improvements,  five  to  15  years;  leasehold  improvements,  three  to  20  years;  and  furniture  and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Leases\n",
      "\n",
      "We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use  ('ROU')  assets,  other  current  liabilities,  and  operating  lease  liabilities  in  our  consolidated balance  sheets.  Finance  leases  are  included  in  property  and  equipment,  other  current  liabilities,  and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "## PART II Item 8\n",
      "\n",
      "ROU  assets  represent  our  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  and  lease  liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease  term.  As  most  of  our  leases  do  not  provide  an  implicit  rate,  we  generally  use  our  incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the  lease  payments  at  commencement  date.  The  operating  lease  ROU  asset  also  includes  any  lease payments  made  and  excludes  lease  incentives.  Our  lease  terms  may  include  options  to  extend  or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately.  For  certain  equipment  leases,  such  as  vehicles,  we  account  for  the  lease  and  non-lease components  as  a  single  lease  component.  Additionally,  for  certain  equipment  leases,  we  apply  a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Goodwill\n",
      "\n",
      "Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating  segment)  on  an  annual  basis  (May  1)  and  between  annual  tests  if  an  event  occurs  or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\n",

      "Microsoft  Mobile  Oy,  a  subsidiary  of  Microsoft,  along  with  other  handset  manufacturers  and  network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain  tumors  and  other  adverse  health  effects.  We  assumed  responsibility  for  these  claims  in  our agreement to acquire Nokia's Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the  remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within  the  U.S.  Federal  Communications  Commission  radio  frequency  emission  guidelines  ('FCC Guidelines')  are  pre-empted  by  federal  law.  The  plaintiffs  allege  that  their  handsets  either  operated outside  the  FCC  Guidelines  or  were  manufactured  before  the  FCC  Guidelines  went  into  effect.  The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs' expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and  denied  in  part  the  defendants'  motion  to  exclude  the  plaintiffs'  general  causation  experts.  The defendants filed  an  interlocutory  appeal  to  the  District  of  Columbia  Court  of  Appeals  challenging  the standard  for  evaluating  expert  scientific  evidence.  In  October  2016,  the  Court  of  Appeals  issued  its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for  further  proceedings  under  that  standard.  The  plaintiffs  have  filed  supplemental  expert  evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court.  A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants' motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs' experts that  cell  phones  cause  brain  cancer  and  entered  an  order  excluding  all  of  plaintiffs'  experts  from testifying.\n",

Microsoft  cooperated  throughout  the  period  of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR  violations  and  proposing  a  fine.

      "We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Microsoft  Corporation  and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity, for each of the three years in the  period  ended  June  30,  2023,  and  the  related  notes  (collectively  referred  to  as  the  \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n",

      "We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated  July  27,  2023,  expressed  an  unqualified  opinion  on  the  Company's  internal  control  over financial reporting.\n",

Our responsibility is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company's  financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n",
      "\n",
      "We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements, whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n",

The communication  of  critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the  financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n",

      "## Critical Audit Matter Description\n",
      "\n",
      "The  Company  recognizes  revenue  upon  transfer  of  control  of  promised  products  or  services  to customers  in  an  amount  that  reflects  the  consideration  the  Company  expects  to  receive  in exchange  for  those  products  or  services.  The  Company  offers  customers  the  ability  to  acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Significant  judgment  is  exercised  by  the  Company  in  determining  revenue  recognition  for  these customer agreements, and includes the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services.\n",
      "- The  pattern  of delivery (i.e., timing of when  revenue  is  recognized)  for  each  distinct performance obligation.\n",
      "- Identification  and  treatment  of  contract  terms  that  may  impact  the  timing  and  amount  of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).\n",
      "- Determination  of  stand-alone  selling  prices  for  each  distinct  performance  obligation  and  for products and services that are not sold separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n",
      "\n",
      "Our principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  related  to  the  identification  of  distinct  performance obligations,  the  determination  of  the  timing  of  revenue  recognition,  and  the  estimation  of variable consideration.\n",
      "- We  evaluated  management's  significant accounting policies related to these  customer agreements for reasonableness.\n",
      "- We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:\n",
      "- -Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement.\n",
      "- -Tested management's identification and treatment of contract terms.\n",
      "- -Assessed  the  terms  in  the  customer  agreement  and  evaluated  the  appropriateness  of management's application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.\n",
      "- We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately.\n",
      "- We  tested  the  mathematical  accuracy  of  management's  calculations  of  revenue  and  the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing  issues  that  remain  unresolved  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (\"IRS\").  The  Company remains  under  IRS  audit,  or  subject  to  IRS  audit,  for  tax  years  subsequent  to  2003.  While  the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations,  tax  case  laws,  and  prior-year  audit  settlements.  Given  the  complexity  and  the subjective  nature  of  the  transfer  pricing  issues  that  remain  unresolved  with  the  IRS,  evaluating management's  estimates  relating  to  their  determination  of  uncertain  tax  positions  required extensive  audit  effort  and  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  including  involvement  of  our  tax specialists.\n",

      "Our  principal  audit  procedures  to  evaluate  management's  estimates  of  uncertain  tax  positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls.\n",
      "- We read and evaluated  management's  documentation,  including  relevant  accounting  policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.\n",
      "- We tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.\n",
      "- For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions.\n",
      "- We  evaluated  the  reasonableness  of  management's  estimates  by  considering  how  tax  law, including statutes, regulations and case law, impacted management's judgments.\n",

Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability  of  our  financial  reporting  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting  includes  maintaining  records  that  in  reasonable  detail  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

A  company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the  company's  assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the financial statements.\n",
